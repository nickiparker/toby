#### TOBY

TOBY is an app designed to assist visually impaired
people to be aware of what’s around them and tell
them what objects are nearby so an obstruction or a
danger can be discovered.

Their are 285 million blind and visually impaired people in the world.
Most are independent and are able to go about daily tasks without a
problem, but sometimes need a little extra help.

This is where TOBY assists them... sometimes in the home lighting is
dim and it can prove an issue for visually impaired people to make
out objects that are low in contrast. TOBY will tell them what’s in a
certain room, highlight objects such as toys that could be on the floor
and pose a danger whilst walking around, or simply list the items
there are in the fridge. TOBY will be their friendly guide.

#### About 

This project is being developed as part of my MA Creative App Development with [Falmouth University](http://falmouth.ac.uk). It is currently at prototype stage and the first part came out of a 48 hour App Jam.
